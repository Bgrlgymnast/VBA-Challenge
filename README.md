In this Module Challenge I was able to use VBA to complete the challenge instructions given. Further in-depth detail can be found in the Gitlab Portal to show how I derived to the same conclusions as the examples provided. 
I was able to initiate loops for multiple worksheets in a Workbook, declare variables, create a Sub & end Sub create dimensions, create IF and ElseIF statements all while usings ranges, cells & functions to generate the conclusions requested. I also learned how to set and create column & row names.
