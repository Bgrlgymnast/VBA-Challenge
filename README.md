## Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called "**VBA-challenge**". **Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.**

Inside the new repository that you just created, add any VBA files that you use for this assignment. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

## Instructions

Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

The ticker symbol.

Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The total stock volume of the stock.

The result should look as follows.

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image The solution should match the following image:

 Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

## NOTE
Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## Other Considerations
Use the sheet "**alphabetical_testing.xlsx**" while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes.

Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.

## Take Aways
In this Module Challenge I was able to use VBA to complete the challenge instructions given. Further in-depth detail can be found in the Gitlab Portal to show how I derived to the same conclusions as the examples provided. 
I was able to initiate loops for multiple worksheets in a Workbook, declare variables, create a Sub & end Sub create dimensions, create IF and ElseIF statements all while usings ranges, cells & functions to generate the conclusions requested. I also learned how to set and create column & row names.
